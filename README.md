# hello-world

Hi, My name is Aleix Prats Ferrer and I am a Phd in Physical Sciences, working currently in the private sector but in the process of moving into data science and machine learning.
I expect I will be doing a lot of that in here...
I have lots of hobbies that I am passionate about. One of them is playing jazz music on upright bass (and other instruments), which is the reason for my username.
Other hobbies are running, skateboard, longboard, (sports in general), Origami, reading, science, etc.

Let's see how this goes ;)
